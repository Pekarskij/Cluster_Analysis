Main commands:
	HELP -- calling the HELP command;
	INFOFC -- information about clusters; 
	EXIT -- program exit.
        LOG i -- switches writing logs: i == 0 starts writing, i == 1 stops. No parameter shows current state of writing logs;

Field and histograms:
	GC mean_x mean_y sigma_x sigma_y n -- generating a cloud from n points with center in (mean x, mean y) and disperion (sigma x, sigma y);
	PRINTF -- printing a field to a file;
        HISTOGRAM k -- saves to Field histogram for first coordinate.txt and Field histogram for second coordinate.txt histogram of distribution the points in field. k is number of pieces in histogram;

Buffer:
	BUFFER ADD -- add all clouds from field in buffer;
	BUFFER UNLOAD -- upload all clouds from the buffer in field;
        BUFFER SHIFT v -- shift all clouds in buffer by vector v;
	BUFFER ROTATE phi -- turn all clouds in buffer at an angle phi;	
	BUFFER ZOOM lambda -- compression all clouds in buffer.

Algorithms:
	WAVE delta -- starting the wave algorithm with parameter delta;
	DBSCAN delta k -- starting the DBscan algorithm with parameters delta and k;
	STREE -- starting the spanning tree algorithm;
	KMEANS k -- starting the k means algorithm with parameter k;
        KMCORES k -- starting the k means with cores algorithm with parameters k and p;
	EM k -- starting the EM algorithm with parameter k;
	FOREL R -- starting the FOREL algorithm with parameter R;
	HIERARCHY k t -- starting the hierarchical algorithm with parameters k and t;
        DELAUNAY -- starting the Delaunay triangulation;
